Our Story
We started when our founders, frustrated by spending 60% of their workweek on repetitive tasks like email scheduling, HR paperwork, and data entry, decided there had to be a better way. They built their first automation tool to schedule team meetings intelligently—and saved 10 hours per week instantly.">

<h3 id="our-story">Our Story</h3>
<p>We started when our founders, frustrated by spending 60% of their workweek on repetitive tasks like email scheduling, HR paperwork, and data entry, decided there had to be a better way.
