## Transforming Business Operations Through AI

OpsAutoAI was founded in 2020 with a simple mission: eliminate tedious manual work so businesses can focus on innovation and growth. Today, we're the leading provider of AI-powered operational automation solutions.

### Our Story

We started when our founders, frustrated by spending 60% of their workweek on repetitive tasks like email scheduling, HR paperwork, and data entry, decided there had to be a better way. They built their first automation tool to schedule team meetings intelligently—and saved 10 hours per week instantly.

That success sparked a vision: **What if every repetitive business operation could be automated?**

Today, OpsAutoAI serves over 500 companies worldwide, automating everything from employee onboarding to financial reporting. Our AI models have processed over 50 million tasks, saving our clients a combined 2 million work hours annually.

### What We Believe

**Humans Should Do Human Work** - Strategy, creativity, and relationship-building shouldn't compete with data entry and email sorting.

**AI Should Be Accessible** - Every business, regardless of size or technical expertise, deserves enterprise-grade automation.

**Operations Should Be Seamless** - The best automation is invisible—it just works, in the background, every time.

- **Natural Language Processing** - Understand emails, documents, and requests like a human would
